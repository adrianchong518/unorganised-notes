## Course Curriculum

### Introduction to Software Engineering
- Learn about control flow by drawing state diagrams and using iterations
- Get started with Visual Studio Code
- Cover the basics of C++ programming
- Follow the programming guidelines provided in the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)

### Getting Started with Arduino
- Understand the Arduino hardware by referring to relevant [resources]((https://circuitdigest.com/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-arduino-uno-board-hardware))
- Learn how to correctly wire a breadboard
- Upload programs using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) and [C++](https://github.com/adrianchong518/Mini-Robocon-2018/blob/master/auto-control/src/sample.cpp)
- Practice the [LED Blink](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/basics/Blink) example to turn an LED on and off every second
- Access gyroscope data through the serial port

### Getting Started with Electronic Signals
- Gain an understanding of analogue I/O and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) I/O
- Differentiate between analogue and digital signals

### Final Mission: Building a Robot
Building a BottleSumo robot is the final task of the curriculum.
